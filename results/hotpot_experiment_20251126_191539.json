Let me try a more targeted lookup in the Ewan MacColl page to find spouse information.  \nAction: Lookup[married]  \n\nObservation: He was married to theatre director Joan Littlewood from 1934 to 1950, and later to American folk singer Peggy Seeger from 1977 until his death.  \n\nThought 5: This still only shows two wives, but I know from general knowledge that Jean Newlove was also his wife. Perhaps the Wikipedia entry is incomplete or I need to check Jean Newlove's page directly for her nationality and marriage details.  \nAction: Search[Jean Newlove]  \n\nObservation: Jean Newlove (1923–2017) was a British dancer, choreographer, and author, best known for her work in the theatre and for her marriage to folk singer Ewan MacColl.  \n\nThought 6: Perfect. The observation confirms Jean Newlove was British. Since the question asks about \"James Henry Miller's wife\" without specification, and multiple wives exist, but based on common interpretation in such tasks, it often refers to a notable spouse. However, all his wives' nationalities are known: Joan Littlewood (British), Jean Newlove (British), Peggy Seeger (American). The answer could be British if referring to Joan or Jean, or American if referring to Peggy.
