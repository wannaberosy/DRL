However, based on general knowledge of the British monarchy and constitutional conventions:\n\n- In the United Kingdom, the monarch is the head of state and does not swear fealty to any individual, as there is no higher temporal authority.\n- During the coronation, King Charles III took a coronation oath in which he swore to uphold the laws of the land, maintain the Church of England, and govern justly — but this was not an act of fealty to another person.\n- Fealty is typically sworn by vassals to lords in feudal systems; the modern British monarchy operates under a constitutional framework where the sovereign is above such obligations.\n\nTherefore, King Charles III did not swear fealty to anyone.

Since direct searches are returning irrelevant results, I will try to use a known fact about the British coronation ceremony: during his coronation, King Charles III took an oath, but it was not one of fealty to another person—monarchs do not swear fealty to anyone above them. Instead, they may swear to uphold laws and the Church.\n\nGiven constitutional tradition in the United Kingdom, the monarch is the head of state and does not owe allegiance to any higher authority.
